Write an R function called 'Unique' which takes an arbitrary vector/list as input and returns a vector containing all the unique elements of that vector/list. DO NOT use the following functions: unique, duplicated, %in%, table or match. The unique elements do not need to be returned in any particular order. The output vector does not need to have names, even if the input vector did have names.
