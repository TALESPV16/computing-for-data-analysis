Computing for Data Analysis
===========================

An open course from coursera.org. https://www.coursera.org/course/compdata
I record my experience and code here.

This course is about learning the fundamental computing skills necessary 
for effective data analysis. You will learn to program in R and to use R 
for reading data, writing functions, making informative graphs, and 
applying modern statistical methods.
